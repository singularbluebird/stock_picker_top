# Stock Picker
This is the stock-picker project from The Odin Project. The input will be a one-dimensional array of integers, with the index representing the day and the value representing the price of the stock. The output will be an array with the first pair of integers which maximizes the profit from buying or selling the stock (i.e. the biggest difference).
